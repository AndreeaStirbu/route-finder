# route-finder

OBJECTIVE:
Our objective is creating a best Route comparison engine. Considering a departure and destination point, a trip duration and a budget, the system should provide with interconnecting flight options that fit these specifications.

This engine can be used by many kind of users, people who want to:
    - travel to many cities, finding the cheapest route
    - go from A to B, but doing it directly is too expensive, so prefer to see if they can get a cheaper price by taking extra flights.


Languages used:
    C#, SQL

Skills that will be improved:
    User Interface Design
    Writing queries
    Learning C# 
    Applying SOLID design principles
    Getting better with Version Control (git)
